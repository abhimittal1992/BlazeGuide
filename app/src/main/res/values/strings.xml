        "Material is the metaphor.\n\n"

        "A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion."
        "The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet "
        "technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.\n"
        "Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are grounded in reality. The "
        "use of familiar tactile attributes helps users quickly understand affordances. Yet the "
        "flexibility of the material creates new affordances that supercede those in the physical "
        "world, without breaking the rules of physics.\n"
        "The fundamentals of light, surface, and movement are key to conveying how objects move, "
        "interact, and exist in space and in relation to each other. Realistic lighting shows "
        "seams, divides space, and indicates moving parts.\n\n"

        "Bold, graphic, intentional.\n\n"

        "The foundational elements of print based design typography, grids, space, scale, color, "
        "and use of imagery guide visual treatments. These elements do far more than please the "
        "eye. They create hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Deliberate color choices, edge to edge "
        "imagery, large scale typography, and intentional white space create a bold and graphic "
        "interface that immerse the user in the experience.\n"
        "An emphasis on user actions makes core functionality immediately apparent and provides "
        "waypoints for the user.\n\n"

        "Motion provides meaning.\n\n"

        "Motion respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover. Primary user actions are "
        "inflection points that initiate motion, transforming the whole design.\n"
        "All action takes place in a single environment. Objects are presented to the user without "
        "breaking the continuity of experience even as they transform and reorganize.\n"
        "Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity. "
        "Feedback is subtle yet clear. Transitions are efﬁcient yet coherent.\n\n"

        "3D world.\n\n"

        "The material environment is a 3D space, which means all objects have x, y, and z "
        "dimensions. The z-axis is perpendicularly aligned to the plane of the display, with the "
        "positive z-axis extending towards the viewer. Every sheet of material occupies a single "
        "position along the z-axis and has a standard 1dp thickness.\n"
        "On the web, the z-axis is used for layering and not for perspective. The 3D world is "
        "emulated by manipulating the y-axis.\n\n"

        "Light and shadow.\n\n"

        "Within the material environment, virtual lights illuminate the scene. Key lights create "
        "directional shadows, while ambient light creates soft shadows from all angles.\n"
        "Shadows in the material environment are cast by these two light sources. In Android "
        "development, shadows occur when light sources are blocked by sheets of material at "
        "various positions along the z-axis. On the web, shadows are depicted by manipulating the "
        "y-axis only. The following example shows the card with a height of 6dp.\n\n"

        "Resting elevation.\n\n"

        "All material objects, regardless of size, have a resting elevation, or default elevation "
        "that does not change. If an object changes elevation, it should return to its resting "
        "elevation as soon as possible.\n\n"

        "Component elevations.\n\n"

        "The resting elevation for a component type is consistent across apps (e.g., FAB elevation "
        "does not vary from 6dp in one app to 16dp in another app).\n"
        "Components may have different resting elevations across platforms, depending on the depth "
        "of the environment (e.g., TV has a greater depth than mobile or desktop).\n\n"

        "Responsive elevation and dynamic elevation offsets.\n\n"

        "Some component types have responsive elevation, meaning they change elevation in response "
        "to user input (e.g., normal, focused, and pressed) or system events. These elevation "
        "changes are consistently implemented using dynamic elevation offsets.\n"
        "Dynamic elevation offsets are the goal elevation that a component moves towards, relative "
        "to the component’s resting state. They ensure that elevation changes are consistent "
        "across actions and component types. For example, all components that lift on press have "
        "the same elevation change relative to their resting elevation.\n"
        "Once the input event is completed or cancelled, the component will return to its resting "
        "elevation.\n\n"

        "Avoiding elevation interference.\n\n"

        "Components with responsive elevations may encounter other components as they move between "
        "their resting elevations and dynamic elevation offsets. Because material cannot pass "
        "through other material, components avoid interfering with one another any number of ways, "
        "whether on a per component basis or using the entire app layout.\n"
        "On a component level, components can move or be removed before they cause interference. "
        "For example, a floating action button (FAB) can disappear or move off screen before a "
        "user picks up a card, or it can move if a snackbar appears.\n"
        "On the layout level, design your app layout to minimize opportunities for interference. "
        "For example, position the FAB to one side of stream of a cards so the FAB won’t interfere "
        "when a user tries to pick up one of cards.\n\n"

    <string name="attackingtip">You can either attack solo or do a rally with clan-mates, things to need to do before attacking any city\n1.Scout first to get the info of troops/traps/knight of defending city for better scout result make sure your scout research is 8/10\n2.If you are strong enough to take the smaller city and you dont wanna let defender alert or bubble by scouting then do the quick attack by teleporting next to him\n3.Before attacking any decent upgraded city just prepare the attack first check attack preparation tip for that.</string>

    <string name="onehitrally">If you wanna hit opponent only single time than its better the rally leader gets all the reinforcements and teleport near enemy in the last few secs </string>
    <string name="multihitrally">For multi-hit rally, all the rally participents need to teleport near opponent so the rally leader start rally again and to protect from opponent clan-mates they need to use their extra marches to set camps to cover all space so that no one can teleport in that particular area.</string>

    <string name="title_activity_kvk">kvk</string>
    <string name="counterRally">Counter rally is like when your under attacked by a rally then how to counter it and set rally to your attacker \n When your under attacked by someone you just need to port somewhere far away and take a 2h bubble in last secs, by this the attacker troops will have to go through with the long march so while attacker troops are returning you can teleport there with your rally mates and start a rally on him , he cant bubble because his march is still out.</string>
    <string name="trapCity">To make your city as trap city first to need to have following things\n1.Max Embassy: so you can have max reinforcements recommended to have t4s reinforced\n2.Max Armory:Build max lvl traps\n3.Wear Max Trap/defense Dragon accessories\n4.Troops count equal to hospital capacity so the troop lost is zero\n5.Lord/Dragon Skills on Traps/Defense\n6.Max Defensive Research(Traps+troop defense+troop life)\n7.Max Knight Lvl assigned as Engineer and commander\n8.Max VIP level and activated while defending\n\nDont worry if you dont have these at max level but that is recommended to make a greatest ever trap city\nIf you have the above things ready then your ready just lure your enemy to attack you, they will lose more troops everytime they attack and you just need to heal your troops/traps nothing else thats it no more building/training. </string>
    <string name="hospitalCaptroopcap"> This is the best ratio if you want to play defensive although you can have more troop and you can set extra troops to camp, but if you dont wanna do this just follow this you will be getting more kill forces without even attacking killing :)</string>
    <string name="ldhrepeat">To perform this first you need to learn how to lure enemy so to lure them just do 1 troop attack without using your dragon else your dragon will get captured, just be unshielded and teleport next to your enemy will make your opponent furious and he may attack you,keep on scouting you enemy will also make him attack you after making your opponent attack you now its time to defend.\n\nBecause you have exact same troops as your hospitals so dont worry you wont lose any\n After getting hit or if your hospitals are full just take 2h bubble(so you can get rss supply easily)and start healing when you done healing its time to repeat what you have done :) Just remember always have a bubbled bank with you which can provide rss when you need it to heal</string>

    <string name="soloattacking">To perform solo attack you need to know about march capacity,  the max march capacity anyone can have without boost is 300k with max boost(50% march boost) is 450k so while attacking keep in mind you can only attack with max 450k troops so while attacking with t3 troops if you wanna win that attack then to be on safe side just attack only those opponents who got troops half of your march capacity dont attack who got more troops than your march size, its  depends on the research,dragon equipments,lord/dragon skills. you can check it in bonus comparision which is available in the reports  </string>
    <string name="soloattackpart2">As you can see the red arrow shows your bonus is less than your enemy so work on that make it better than your opponent and you will win that.\n While performing an attack with t4s you can kill anyone having t3s easily below are some reports</string>

    <string name="meatShield">MeatShield is very important if you wanna secure your higher lvl troops means if you have t3s than train some t1 troops as a meatshield while attacking someone and if you have t4s than use t3 as meat shield to be very precise suppose your march capacity is 300k and you have t3 troops, To attack someone then use 15-20k t1 troops rest t3s the benefit is only your t1 troops get killed and your t3 will get saved</string>
    <string name="attackpreparation">To perform a good attack you need to prepare for it first, dont rush and send marches in hurry.\n\n1.Use march boost to increase the size of army you can send at a time \n2.You need to have atleast two high lvl knight, assign one in commander and send one with your march to attack\n3.Use Attack Boost\n4.Reset Lord/Dragon skills on troops attack\n5.You should have good troop life research\n6.Dont forget to wear best attacking dragon equipments.\n7.Make sure your VIP is active</string>
